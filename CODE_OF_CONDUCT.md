# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as management of Pine View Software AS, a legal entity incorporated in Norway (the Company), pledge to making participation in our projects and our company a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sex characteristics, disability, ethnicity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, body size, race, religion (or lack thereof), or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language - please read the [inclusive language guidance](https://www.uua.org/lgbtq/welcoming/ways/200008.shtml) from the UUA
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Exercising consideration and respect in your speech and actions
* Attempting collaboration before conflict or criticism

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, spamming, intentionally disrupting conversations, making insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing or threatening to publish others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Our Responsibilities

Management and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Management and project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, articles, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently terminate the employment agreement or any other form of collaboration for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within business spaces, either online or on the physical premises of the Company, and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official Company e-mail address, posting via an official social media account of the Company or project, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project or the Company may be further defined and clarified by management or project owners.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the Company at hello@pineview.io. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The management team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project owners who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the Company's leadership.
